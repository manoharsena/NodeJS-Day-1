**This repository is created for File System task using Express JS**

- This application creates a web server on `port 4000` with two endpoints. 
  
- The root endpoint creates a text file with the current timestamp and save the text file in the folder `Current_Timestamp`.
   
- The `/getTextFiles` endpoint retrieves and displays the name of all text files in the `Current_Timestamp` folder.


## NodeJS
  - It is used for server-side programming, and primarily deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers, such as traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was originally designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind. Every browser has its own version of a JS engine, and node.

## ExpressJS
  - Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application. It's a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes.
